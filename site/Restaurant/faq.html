            <p class="menu-item-details">Car detailing and car washing are two entirely different things. A good way to look at it is, a wash is kind of like maintenance. A wash should be done regularly to protect the paint of the vehicle.Road tar, bug guts, fine dust and tree sap are just a few of the things your vehicle encounter daily, and need to be removed. A wash includes an interior vacuum, a wipe down of the interior and a window cleaning, it's a very basic cleaning of day to day mess.

            <p class="menu-item-details">A detail is a very in depth cleaning of the entire vehicle from bumper to bumper. The goal of a detail should be to clean the car to a like new status. A detail usually will include a wash of the exterior. Tires and wheels cleaned and shined, Wheel walls cleaned and shined, Windows cleaned inside and out, wax or polish applied, engine cleaned, interior vacuumed thoroughly underneath seats, behind seats and between seats. Cup holders, pockets, cubby areas, door panels all cleaned, door jams wiped down, carpets shampooed, seats shampooed (cleaned and conditioned if leather), floor mats shampooed. </p>

            <p class="menu-item-details">Very easy to see there are huge differences between a wash and a detail. Though they may be different they are both needed to maintain your vehicles beauty and value.</p></p>

            <p class="menu-item-details">If you we were talking about a true mobile detail company the customers should need to provide nothing but access to the vehicle. Here at Stay Shining we have a fully mobile unit equipped with 125 gallons of clean water that has been treated at a high level to protect your car from the nasty contaminants that come out of the normal city water. In addition we only use high end detail and wash products. Chemical Guys, Pro Beauty, Maguire's, are some of the more popular names of chemicals that can be fid on our truck, and another handful of our chemicals come from a local supplier that supplies majority of local car washes and detail shops around yhe valley. We also have a generator for power, so there is no need to ask a customer to use there outlets. We have vacuums, hot water carpet extractors, and orbital buffers to ensure the detail job we are called for is done to a standard you would expect from your high end local detail shop.</p>

You can expect the detailer to show up within the time window given, upon arrival you will be greeted and your car will be looked at by the the detailer and yourself major areas of concern will be discussed along with projected outcomes. After that you can go back and handle life things or just relax. When the job is done we will let you know and it's as simple as that.</p>
