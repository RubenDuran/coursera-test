The products found at your local store or auto store are OK, but not professional grade here at stay shining we recommend staying away from those products. You will not see any of those things on our trucks. Our major product line we use is distributed by a local car wash supplier who supplies detail shops and car washes around  the valley. We also use brands like Maguire's, Pro Beauty, and Groits Garage. Everything that is used is 100% safe to apply to your vehicle.</p>
